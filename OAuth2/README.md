OAuth2
======

OAuth2 frameworks for **OS X** and **iOS** written in Swift.

The code in this repo requires Xcode 6, the built framework can be used on **OS X 10.9** or **iOS 7** and later.
Supported OAuth2 [flows](#flows) are the _code grant_ (`response_type=code`) and the _implicit grant_ (`response_type=token`).


Usage
-----

For a typical code grant flow you want to perform the following steps.
The steps for other flows are mostly the same short of instantiating a different subclass and using different client settings.

1. Create a settings dictionary.
	
	```swift
	settings = [
		"client_id" = "my_swift_app",
		"client_secret" = "C7447242-A0CF-47C5-BAC7-B38BA91970A9",
		"authorize_uri" = "https://authorize.smartplatforms.org/authorize",
		"token_uri" = "https://authorize.smartplatforms.org/token",
	]
	```

2. Create an `OAuth2CodeGrant` instance, setting the `onAuthorize` and `onFailure` closures to keep informed about the status.
	
	```swift
	let oauth = OAuth2CodeGrant(settings: settings)
	oauth.onAuthorize = { parameters in
		println("Did authorize with parameters: \(parameters)")
	}
	oauth.onFailure = { error in		// `error` is nil on cancel
		if nil != error {
			println("Authorization went wrong: \(error!.localizedDescription)")
		}
	}
	```

3. Now either use the built-in web view controller or manually open the _authorize URL_ in the browser:
	
	```swift
	let redir = "myapp://callback"        // don't forget to register this scheme
	let scope = "profile email"
	```
	
	**Embedded**:
	
	```swift
	let vc = <# presenting view controller #>
	let web = oauth.authorizeEmbedded(redir, scope: scope, params: nil, from: vc)
	oauth.afterAuthorizeOrFailure = { wasFailure in
		web.dismissViewControllerAnimated(true, completion: nil)
	}
	```
	
	**OS browser**:
	
	```swift
	let url = oauth.authorizeURLWithRedirect(redir, scope: scope, params: nil)
	UIApplication.sharedApplication().openURL(url)
	```
	
	Since you opened the authorize URL in the browser you will need to intercept the callback in your app delegate.
	Let the OAuth2 instance handle the full URL.
	
	```swift
	func application(application: UIApplication!,
	                 openURL url: NSURL!,
	           sourceApplication: String!,
	                  annotation: AnyObject!) -> Bool {
		// you should probably first check if this is your URL being opened
		if <# check #> { 
			oauth.handleRedirectURL(url)
		}
	}
	```

4. After everything completes either the `onAuthorize` or the `onFailure` closure will be called, and after that the `afterAuthorizeOrFailure` closure if it has been set.

5. You can now obtain an `OAuth2Request`, which is an already signed `NSMutableURLRequest`, to retrieve data from your server.
	
	```swift
	let req = oauth.request(forURL: <# resource URL #>)
	let session = NSURLSession.sharedSession()
	let task = session.dataTaskWithRequest(req) { data, response, error in
		if nil != error {
			// something went wrong
		}
		else {
			// check the response and the data
			// you have just received data with an OAuth2-signed request!
		}
	}
	task.resume()
	``` 


Flows
-----

Based on which OAuth2 flow that you need to use you will want to use the correct subclass.
For a very nice explanation of OAuth's basics: [The OAuth Bible](http://oauthbible.com/#oauth-2-three-legged).

#### Code Grant

For a full OAuth 2 code grant flow you want to use the `OAuth2CodeGrant` class.
This flow is typically used by applications that can guard their secrets, like server-side apps, and not in distributed binaries.
In case an application cannot guard its secret, such as a distributed iOS app, you would use the _implicit grant_ or, in some cases, still a _code grant_ but omitting the client secret.

#### Implicit Grant

An implicit grant is suitable for apps that are not capable of guarding their secret, such as distributed binaries or client-side web apps.
Use the `OAuth2ImplicitGrant` class to receive a token and perform requests.

Would be nice to add another code example here, but it's pretty much the same as for the _code grant_.


Playground
----------

The idea is to add a Playground to see OAuth2 in use (instead of a sample app).
However, it's not currently possible to interact view WebViews inside a playground, which would be needed to login to a demo server.

There is some stub code in `OSX.playground` if you'd like to tinker.
It's not working as one needs to open the authorize URL in a browser, then copy-paste the redirect URL from OS X's warning window into the Playground â€“ which makes OAuth2 regenerate its state, making your redirect URL invalid.
Fun times.
